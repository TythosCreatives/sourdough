Sourdough
=========

Sourdough provides a quick-start project template for rapidly iterating on a
web application with the following:

* Submodule-based dependency control

* AMD-based (RequireJS) performant module loaders

* A Single-File JavaScript Module (SFJM) architecture

* Triplet-based UI components

To run, you should self-host using something like "python -m http.sever", then
browse to the appropriate URL (say, "localhost:8000"). You should see this
README appear. Self-hosting is required for XMLHttpRequest loading of
application assets.

Because dependency management is submodule-based, be sure to initialize/update
submodules with Git once the project is cloned.
